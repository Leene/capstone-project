# Emmet Typing Game

This is a emmet typing game for mobile. It has the total innovative name "Emmet Typing Game" and a fancy ingame keyboard for easier access to necessary special characters. If you are too lazy to clone from github, you can check out its Codesandbox version under https://76fn3.csb.app.

## The Idea

Emmet expressions are a kind of short-cuts for code snippets of different languages like html, css, js etc. The Use of them can boost your coding speed and productivity. But at first sight I thought they are looking confusing and unclear (especially the long ones). So I thought it would be useful to have a little game to practice them.

## Project Background

Originally this Project had started as capstone-project of a Web Developer Bootcamp I attended in March 2020. The task was to build a little mobile app in react.js. The project idea was totally free.

## Used Programming Technologies

Main Technology is React.js. In detail you find the usage of 
 - Functional programming as basic concept
 - JSX (styled components)
 - Reach router navigation
 - Props
 - State hooks

## Planned Improvements
- Delete Button for single characters
- Adding more then 5 questions in the game
- Desktop version, where you can use your hardware keyboard
- Little animations for life and score counter
